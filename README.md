Pixel Manipulation
It’s a simple image program which can load any image, then either scramble its pixels randomly, invert its colors, or make it brighter. I used Python’s Tkinter for the interface and Pillow for handling the image operations. It’s more of a visual obfuscation demo to show how data can be altered in a way that hides the original.
